    - updated testing some more to handle cross-platform math inaccuracies

1.102521  2010-09-10 01:28:33 Europe/Berlin
    - updated tests to fit JSON sorting

1.102520  2010-09-09 23:46:51 Europe/Berlin

    - some internal restructuring
    - extended capabilities of metrics:
        - they can declare themselves statistically insignificant now to hint
          reporters as to how to handle them
        - they can define a short name for themselves now, for reporters to use
    - support/incompatible logic actually works now
    - added calculation of deviation from the standard for each entry in the
      top/bottom tables

1.102360  2010-08-24 13:28:43 Europe/Berlin
